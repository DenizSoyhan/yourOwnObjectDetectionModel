Creating your own Object Detection Model might seem like a daunting task but FEAR NOT!
With Yolov4 and our guidance through this repo you will get your very own object detection model for any video game in no time. And you might be able to use this model for way more than just video games(spoilers!)
# 0) Preparation:
You will need some tools to get everything working so please get these dependencies figured out before we start:
\n*pywin32
*numpy
*Pillow
*opencv-python
*jupyter
*pynput

# 1) DATA COLLECTION
In order to train your model you need to collect vast amount of data. The more data you have the better you can train your model. Most of the time you need to find different data bases that suits your purposes and occasionally these data bases will be behind a pay wall. So why not collect your own.
